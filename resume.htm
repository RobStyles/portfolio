                Personal Interests
            </h3>
            <p>Some of my personal interests are building model kits, listening to</p>
            <p>music, playing video games, and taking afternoon naps. I like building</p>
            <p>model kits as I find it challenging yet relaxing, as well as it being </p>
            <p>a good way to pass time. My favorite genre of music to listen to is </p>
            <p>metal and all the sub genres that it encapsulates because i really </p>
            <p>like the heavy vocals and guitars. Playing video games has always been</p>
            <p>a part of my life sence my childhood, so over time I have accumulated </p>
            <p>a large collection of games and consoles ranging from early home</p>
            <p>entertainment systems such as the NES and Sega Genesis, to more modern</p>
            <P>systems like the PS5 and Nintendo Switch. As much as I love all my</P>
            <p>aforementioned hobbies nothing beats an afternoon nap to re-energize</p>
            <p>after being around other people.</p>
